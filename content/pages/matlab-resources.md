MATLAB® Resources at MIT
------------------------

[Introduction to MATLAB](/courses/res-18-002-introduction-to-matlab-spring-2008), class materials that were developed by Yossi Farjoun of the MIT Department of Mathematics for a non-credit program during MIT's Independent Activities Period.  A collection of additional MATLAB resources are also linked from this web site, including teaching codes and tutorials.
